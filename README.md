# CustomObjectDetection
I've learned a bit of machine learning and a bit of computer vision. Trying object detection next.
Language - Python

3 week project for class. Learning the basics of Custom Object Detection.

Since the time frame was limited, real world data would be slightly difficult. The objects I'm detecting are enemies in a game called MUCK on steam.

Trained the model over 100 epochs, The results were ~okay~, the model could detect what the enemies sometimes. 

The majority of the time it could accurately predict the top left corner but fail miserably on the bottom left corner.
